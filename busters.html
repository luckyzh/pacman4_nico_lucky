<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>Pacman spends his life running from ghosts, but things were not always so. Legend has it that many years
ago, Pacman's great grandfather Grandpac learned to hunt ghosts for sport. However, he was blinded by his
power and could only track ghosts by their banging and clanging.</p>

<p>In this project, you will design Pacman agents that use sensors to 
locate and eat invisible ghosts. You'll advance from locating single,
stationary ghosts to hunting moving ghosts.</p>

<p>The code for this project contains the following files, 
available as a <a href="tracking.zip">zip archive</a>.</p>

<p> <p><strong>What to submit:</strong> You will fill in and then submit portions of <code><a href="docs/bustersAgents.html">bustersAgents.py</a></code> and
<code><a href="docs/inference.html">inference.py</a></code>.
Please <em>do not</em> change the other files in this distribution or submit any of the original files other than <code><a href="docs/inference.html">inference.py</a></code> and <code><a href="docs/bustersAgents.html">bustersAgents.py</a></code>.</p>

<p>As always, use <code>turnin</code> to submit your work. Each team should
submit only one copy of the relevant files.  In addition, please send me
an email with the following information:
<ul>
<li>the names of both members of the team and
<li>the name under which the work has been submitted.
</ul></p>

<p><strong>Evaluation:</strong> Your code will be autograded for technical
correctness. Please <em>do not</em> change the names of any provided functions or classes within the code, 
or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. However, the correctness of your implementation -- not the 
autograder's judgements -- will be the final judge of your score.

<h3>Ghostbusters and BNs</h3>
<p>The goal for this assignment is to hunt down scared but invisible ghosts. 
Pacman, ever resourceful, is equipped with sonar (ears) that provides noisy readings of the 
Manhattan distance to each ghost. The game ends when Pacman has eaten all the ghosts.  
To start, try playing a game yourself using the keyboard.

<pre>  python busters.py</pre>

<p>The blocks of color indicate where each ghost could possibly be, given the noisy distance 
readings provided to Pacman.  The noisy distances at the bottom of the display are always non-negative, 
and always within 7 of the true distance.  The probability of a distance reading decreases exponentially 
with its difference from the true distance.  
        
<p>Your primary task in this project is to implement inference to track the ghosts.  
A crude form of inference is implemented for you by default: all squares in which a 
ghost could possibly be are shaded by the color of the ghost.      
<pre>  python busters.py -k 1</pre>

<p>Naturally, you want a better estimate of the ghost's position.  You will start by locating a 
single, stationary ghost using multiple noisy distance readings. The default 
<code>BustersKeyboardAgent</code> in <code><a href="docs/bustersAgents.html">bustersAgents.py</a></code> uses the 
<code>ExactInference</code> module in <code><a href="docs/inference.html">inference.py</a></code> to track ghosts.  
<i>Hint:</i>As you're debugging, you'll find it useful to actually see where the ghost is. Use option <code>-s</code>, when running Pacman
<pre>  python busters.py -s -k 1</pre>

 
<p><em><strong>Question 1 (3 points)</em></strong>  Update the <code>observe</code> method in 
<code>ExactInference</code> class of <code><a href="docs/inference.html">inference.py</a></code> to correctly update the agent's 
belief distribution over ghost positions.
When complete, you should be able to accurately locate a 
ghost by circling it.

<pre>  python busters.py -s -k 1 -g StationaryGhost</pre>

<p> Because the default <code>StationaryGhost</code> ghost agents don't move,
you can track each one separately.  The default <code>BustersKeyboardAgent</code> is set up to 
do this for you.  Hence, you should be able to locate multiple stationary ghosts simultaneously.  
Encircling the ghosts should give you precise distributions over the ghosts' locations.

<pre>  python busters.py -s -g StationaryGhost</pre>

<p> <em>Note:</em>  your busters agents have a separate inference module for each ghost they are tracking.
That's why if you print an observation inside the <code>observe</code> function, you'll only see a
single number even though there may be multiple ghosts on the board.

<p>
Hints: 
<ul>
    <li>You are implementing the online belief update for observing new evidence. Before
    	any readings, Pacman believes the ghost could be anywhere: a uniform prior (see 
    	<code>initializeUniformly</code>). After receiving a reading, the 
    	<code>observe</code> function is called, which must update the belief at every
    	position.
    <li>Before typing any code, write down the equation of the inference problem you are 
    	trying to solve.
    <li>Try printing <code>noisyDistance</code>, <code>emissionModel</code>, and 
    	<code>PacmanPosition</code> (in the <code>observe</code> function) to get
    	started.
    <li>In the Pacman display, high posterior beliefs are represented by bright colors, 
    	while low beliefs are represented by dim colors.  You should start with a large 
    	cloud of belief that shrinks over time as more evidence accumulates.
    <li>Beliefs are stored as <code>util.Counter</code> objects (like dictionaries) in a 
    	field called <code> self.beliefs</code>, which you should update.
    <li>You should not need to store any evidence.  The only thing you need to store in     
    	<code>ExactInference</code> is <code>self.beliefs</code>.
</ul>




<p> Ghosts don't hold still forever.  Fortunately, your agent has access to the action distribution 
for any <code>GhostAgent</code>.  Your next task is to use the ghost's move distribution to update 
your agent's beliefs when time elapses and ghosts move.


<p><strong><em>Question 2 (4 points) </em></strong> Fill in the <code>elapseTime</code> method in 
<code>ExactInference</code> to correctly update the agent's belief distribution over the ghost's 
position when the ghost moves.  When complete, you should be able to accurately locate moving ghosts, 
but some uncertainty will always remain about a ghost's position as it moves. To test it out, you can 
use the <code>DirectionalGhost</code> ghost agent, which causes the ghosts to move in a somewhat
predictable fashion. If you don't include <code>-g DirectionalGhost</code>, then the ghost will
move randomly, which will be harder to track, though it should still be possible.

<pre>  python busters.py -s -k 1 -g DirectionalGhost</pre>
<pre>  python busters.py -s -k 1</pre>
    
<p>Hints: 
<ul>
<li> Instructions for obtaining a distribution over where a ghost will go next, given its current 
	position and the <code>gameState</code>, appears in the comments of 
	<code>ExactInference.elapseTime</code> in <code><a href="docs/inference.html">inference.py</a></code>.
<li> A <code>DirectionalGhost</code> is easier to track because it is more predictable.  
	After running away from one for a while, your agent should have a good idea where it is.
<li> You can assume that ghosts still move independently of one another, so while you can develop all 
	of your code for one ghost at a time, adding multiple ghosts should still work correctly.
</ul>

<p>Now that Pacman can track ghosts, try playing without peeking at the ghost locations.  Beliefs about each ghost will be overlaid on the screen.  The game should be challenging, but not impossible.

<pre>  python busters.py -l bigHunt</pre>

<p>Now, Pacman is ready to hunt down ghosts on his own. You will implement a simple greedy hunting strategy, where Pacman assumes that each ghost is in its most likely position according to its beliefs, then moves toward the closest ghost.  

<p><strong><em>Question 3 (4 points) </em></strong> Implement the <code>chooseAction</code> method in <code>GreedyBustersAgent</code> in <code><a href="docs/bustersAgents.html">bustersAgents.py</a></code>.  Your agent should first find the most likely position of each remaining (uncaptured) ghost, then choose an action that minimizes the distance to the closest ghost.  If correctly implemented, your
agent should win <code>smallHunt</code> with a score greater than 700 at least
8 out of 10 times. <em>Note:</em> the autograder will check the
correctness of your inference directly, not the outcome of games, but it's a reasonable sanity check.
    
<pre>  python busters.py -p GreedyBustersAgent -l smallHunt</pre>
    
Hints: 
<ul>
    <li> When correctly implemented, your agent will thrash around a bit in order to capture a ghost.
    <li> The comments of <code>chooseAction</code> provide you with useful method calls for computing maze distance and successor positions.
    <li> Make sure to only consider the living ghosts, as described in the comments.
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Approximate Q-Learning Extra Credit (<b>4</b> points) </em></strong>
A number of you were eager to improve on your approximate q-learning agents
from the previous assignment.  Because Project 4 (Ghostbusters) is shorter than most,
this is a good opportunity to do that -- and to earn extra credit for it.

<p>As you all saw, the features extracted by <code>SimpleExtractor</code> allowed Pacman to learn how to
play pretty well.  After training, he typically ate all the food and avoided ghosts, winning on
the <code>mediumClassic</code> layout with scores a bit over 1300.  As many of you also
noted, Pacman played quite conservatively.  He didn't go after capsules or scared ghosts.
</p>

<p>For extra credit, modify the <code>getFeatures</code> method in <code>SimpleExtractor</code>
in <code>featureExtractors.py</code> to return a new and improved set of features with which
Pacman can learn to play more aggressively.</p>

<p>Grading: I will run my approximate q-learning agent with your features on the
<code>mediumClassic</code> layout 10 times after training on 50 games.

<pre> python pacman.py -p ApproximateQAgent -a extractor=SimpleExtractor -x 50 -n 60 -l mediumClassic </pre>

<p>I will assign extra credit points in the following way:
<ul>
<li> +1 for an average winning score of at least 1500</li>
<li> +1 more for an average winning score of at least 1600</li>
<li> +1 more for an average winning score of at least 1700</li>
<li> +1 more for an average winning score of at least 1800</li>
<li> The additional points for average score will only be awarded if you win at least
6 times. </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>If you choose to do the extra credit, please turn in the file <code>featureExtractors.py</code>
with your Ghostbusters code.</p>
